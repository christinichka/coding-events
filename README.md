# coding-events
A sample project I did as a student to learn how to implement a web-based app with Java/Spring Boot/Gradle/Thymeleaf/Hibernate/SQL

Purpose
This app is similiar to Meetup.com in that it takes in user input of categories of events and event details from a user to be displayed in a table. 

Functionality
This app currently allows users to create a new event, delete an event, create a new event category, see all categories, and see all events. It also includes a two forms in which to add the information for an event or category. The forms have validation so that fields will be filled out with the correct information.

Improvements
In the future I might be able to add a profile where a user can sign up sign in in order to save events of interest to them, or create events for others to see. This feature would need a sign up form with validation on the fields, as well as a sign-in form for the user to enter their username and password to access their profile.
